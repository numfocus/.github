# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by email to `info@numfocus.org`.

If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted privately
in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix release as timely as possible (depending
on the complexity of the fix).
